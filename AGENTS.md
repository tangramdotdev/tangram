Please run `cargo` commands with `--workspace` for better cache hits. Please prefer `cargo clippy` over `cargo check` and clear clippy warnings when you complete tasks. Please do not omit articles in error messages and comments and make comments complete sentences that end in periods and do not use contractions. To run all tests, please run `bun run test`. To run a specific CLI test, run `nu packages/cli/test.nu <pattern>`.
